                        Paper Bride is a Chinese horror mystery puzzle game which includes traditional Chinese folk
                        cultural elements. Download and experience it if you are interested in traditional Chinese
                        culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inspirations: <br>
                        There are lots of creative horror stories in traditional Chinese folklore: paper figures
                        blocking the way, underworld spirits marching, bizarre temples, ghost trap... But these elements
                        are rarely used in games. After having nightmares about Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio,
                        Extensive Records of the Taiping Era, A Wicked Ghost and other novels and movies, we think it's
                        a shame that only we could experience the horror, so we made this traditional Chinese horror
                        mystery puzzle game to share with the world.
                        <br>
                        When the groom turns toward his bride on the wedding ceremony, her traditional red wedding dress
                        suddenly turns into an ominous white paper one before she vanishes without a trace.

                        occult mystery to uncover the secret origins of this haunted village.

                            <li>Added Suspense - Think carefully to overcome your fear and avoid the living dead. This
                                story
                                is not for the feint of heart!</li>
                            <li>In-depth Clues - Added more detailed clues, making the puzzle game more accessible to
                                new
                                players.</li>
                        </ul>
                        We hope to shock players with an all new heart-pounded horror adventure!

                    <p>
                        The blue sky fades to dusk; absent are Yin and Yang. <br>
                        A procession of white robes accompanies the swaying red palanquin. <br>
                        Incense unbroken foretells the enduring matrimony. <br>
                        A joyous celebration welcomes the paper bride's return... <br>
                        <br>
                        Paper Bride3 is a Chinese Horror Puzzle Game. This is our team's third horror puzzle game.
                        <br>
                        The story takes place in the village of Moshui, which is close to the village of Zangling, and
                        in the nearby small town named Fulu. <br>
                        Someone says that do not to marry a woman from Zangling Village, and do not to return to this
                        place again. <br>
                        But is it the way to avoid the shadow of Zangling Village? <br>
                        Guess what? <br>
                        <br>
                        Compared to its predecessor Paper Bride2 Zangling Village, the new story has more attractions:
                        Expression upgrade: More picturesque, more dynamic performance. <br>
                        Plot performance upgrade: Minor roles will also have different expressions. <br>
                        Heartbeat upgrade: Some players feel that the predecessor is not exciting enough, so we decided
                        to use 80% of horror power (If we use 100% full power, we can't be released for sure). <br>
                        This story will be 2.44 times scarier than its predecessor, heart patients do not enter.

                    <p>
                        Pray to the matchmaker for a good marriage. <br>
                        Breathing jade waves in the wind,rising with lingering sentiments. <br>
                        Love is entwined like a red silk, hard to untie... <br>
                        <br>
                        Long time no see,are you still the same as before? <br>
                        Dreams and reality are as one. Who is a ghost, and who is not? Are you still you? <br>
                        <br>
                        "Paper Bride 4 Bound Love" is a Chinese horror puzzle game, the fourth work in the "Paper Bride"
                        series. Welcome everyone to return to the world of Paper Bride. This time, let us uncover the
                        secrets of Yichang Town together. <br>
                        <br>
                        We are trying to create a different experience for each paper bride. In the previous few works,
                        we tried to deconstruct puzzle solving and folklore in different aspects (such as physical
                        puzzle solving, burning paper for ourselves, etc.). <br>
                        And this work, we intend to go back to the basics, try a more traditional direction, and restore
                        the feeling of old-fashioned classic folk movies. <br>
                        <br>
                        New works will continue to be upgraded: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traditional Chinese folk culture upgrade - more Chinese folk culture and metaphysics,
                                more
                                paper puppets.</li>
                            <li>Art upgrade—the art department has a few new monsters (masters), and things like paper
                                figurines will be even weirder.</li>
                            <li>Heartbeat upgrade——Different paper fans have different evaluations on the heartbeat
                                speed of
                                the previous game. Some people said it was more exciting, while others said "it's not as
                                good as
                                the previous one". So this time we dare not use too much force, just increase it by 0.01
                                times! No entrance for heart disease patients!</li>
                        </ul>
